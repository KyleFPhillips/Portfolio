Final Year Project Code 1 & 2 are basic neural network systems used in my dissertation. Code 1 is a basic feed forward network specifically avoiding using any additional machine learning libraries. Code 2 is a form of NLP for sentiment analysis which trains itself to measure sentiment in a written form (the example used is in amazon reviews).
